	<h1 style= "color: maroon; font-family: Georgia">Program Statement</h1>
	<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">During my undergrad I originally was a Computer Science major, because I've always enjoyed problem solving and programming.<br> When I became aware of the emerging field of Data Science, it immediately piqued my interest, as it was the intersection of programming <br>and drawing insights from the real world that could be easily applied in a business context. I decided to get my degree in Business Analytics, <br>and after researching online, found that the jobs I was most interested in typically required a Master's degree; Which has led me to where I<br> am now pursuing my Master's in Business Analytics</p>

	<h1 style= "color: maroon; font-family: Georgia">Career Objectives</h1>
	<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">I don't have a very clearly sketched out picture of the kind of career I would like to have yet, and I hope that will become clearer to me as I <br>gain more experience in the professional workforce. Ideally, I want a job that allows me to make use of my techincal skills in programming,<br> and gives me the flexibility to work on the projects I find most interesting and would be helpful for the company I work for. Career options <br>I am currently considering are:</p>
	<ul style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">
		<li>Data Scientist</li>
		<li>Data Analyst</li>
		<li>Data Engineer</li>
	</ul>
	<h1 style= "color: maroon; font-family: Georgia">Strengths</h1>
	<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">My strengths include:</p>
	<ul style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">
		<li>Thinking outside the box to come to unique solutions</li>
		<li>Very autodidactic and a realtively quick learner</li>
		<li>A strong sense of curiosity that allows me to dive deeply into subjects that interest me</li>
	</ul>
	<h1 style= "color: maroon; font-family: Georgia">Hobbies</h1>
	<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">I am constantly changing hobbies as I get bored of old ones and interested in new ones. Two hobbies I'm currently interested in include:</p>
	<ol style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">
		<li>Learning about <a href="https://www.loc.gov/">American history</a>, particularly eras or perspectives that were only glossed over in my primary and secondary education</li>
